/**
 * Source-shape guards for the audience lens.
 *
 * The lens is a VIEW, not a filter. The distinction is not cosmetic:
 * schedule-ui.ts hides the break bands whenever a filter is active, so a lens
 * implemented as a filter makes lunch and the coffee breaks vanish on switch —
 * which reads as a styling glitch, not a logic error.

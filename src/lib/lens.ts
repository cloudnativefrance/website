 * vitest projects are `environment: "node"`. The decision is tested here; the
 * DOM plumbing that applies it is a loop guarded by source shape. Same split as
 * `resolveEditionLoadable` / `isEditionLoadable` and `getFlagState` /
 * `isFlagActive`.
 *
 * Says nothing about break bands, deliberately. They describe the unfiltered
 * day and belong to both lenses — the filter code hides them because narrowing
 * a day makes them meaningless, which scoping it does not.
